### Travelling Salesman Problem
Find the best path covering all the cities/points without repeating any. This task aims to minimize the total distance or cost of travel, and is widely used in logistics, planning, and routing.

### How to solve it with Genetic Algorithms?
1. We have population of solutions

2. Solutions change with each new generation, mixing and creating potentially better solutions

3. But they often get stuck at some point , and no longer improve in new generations

4. In such case, we need some random unexpected change - a mutation, that will modify solutions
